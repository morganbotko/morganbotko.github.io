<h1> Welcome To The Podcasts Page! </h1>
    
<p> Based on the rest of my website, it is probably not a huge surprise that my favorite podcasts are about celebrtities and entertainment. I love to listen to podcasts while walking around or doing mundane tasks. I listen to podcasts on the Spotify app but most podcasts can be listened to on various platforms, such as the Apple iTunes store or Google Podcasts. </p>
    
    <h3> Here are a list of my favorite podcasts: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Sibling Reverly with Kate Hudson and Oliver Hudson</li>
        <li> Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard </li>

        <li> You're Wrong About </li>
    </ul>
